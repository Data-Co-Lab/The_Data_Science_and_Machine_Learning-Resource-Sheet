# The Data Science and Machine Learning Resourch Sheet (TDSMLRS)
# One sheet to rule them all!

With the explosive amount of information about Data Science, it has become hard to know where to start and what to trust.
Yet we all know that one senior person who seems to always have a link for a subject. This sheet aims to be the sum of all these persons.
All links in the sheet have been careully chosen after watching a lot of alternatives for each subject, and we keep updating if we find better!

## Content of the Sheet: 
Up to now, the sheets contains 5 tabs:
..* AI & DS: Videos, articles & code links to specific items & skills in AI & DS
..* Playlists: Playlists & youtube channels whose content are awesome & easy to follow
..* Courses: Full courses available online for free
..* Datasets: Useful datasets & lists of datasets we encountered, hope you'll find what you need.
..* Projects & Libraries: Useful Open source libraries & repositories you can use, contribute to or follow in your project.
..* Contributors: All the people that helped out, with a message from them, their linkedin & github (if they want). Not all use github so putting a list in public like this will let the contributors shine.
